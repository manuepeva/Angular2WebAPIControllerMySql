			<li>José Gabriel Túpac Amaru (March 10, 1738 – May 18, 1781) — known as Túpac Amaru II — was the leader of a large Andean uprising against the Spanish in Peru, where its quelling resulted in his death.
			</li>
			<br>
			</br>
			<li>He later became a mythical figure in the Peruvian struggle for independence and indigenous rights movement, as well as an inspiration to myriad causes in Spanish America and beyond.</li>
			</ul>
			<br> </br>
			<ul>
			<li>Túpac Amaru II was a cacique (hereditary chief) in the Tinta region of southern Peru. He received a formal Jesuit education but maintained his identification with the Indian population. In 1780 he arrested and executed the corregidor (provincial administrator), Antonio Arriaga, on charges of cruelty.</li>
			<br></br>
			<li>This act led to the last general Indian rebellion against Spain, at first with the support of some Creoles-Criollos- (Spaniards born in America). The revolt, which spread throughout southern Peru and into Bolivia and Argentina, lost this support, however, when it became a violent battle between Indians and Europeans.</li>
			<br>
			</br>
			<li>
				  Túpac Amaru II and his family were captured in March 1781 and taken to Cuzco. After being forced to witness the execution of his wife and sons, he was mutilated by pulling their legs and arms with horses and then beheaded. The revolution continued until the Spanish government issued a general pardon of the insurgents.
